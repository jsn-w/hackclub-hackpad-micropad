These were made in KiCad. There are two layers in this PCB. The top serves as the signal plane while the bottom serves as the ground plane.

# CAD
Here is the assembled piece! I was unable to find 3D models for the LEDs. The microcontroller also wouldn't export to Fusion360. Below I attached the KiCad PCB model and the Fusion360 model.
